# Back-translation

## Translating a dataset
For each `${dataset}`, the back-translated data is already available in `data/${dataset}/back-translations.jsonl`

If you want to run the back-translation yourself, execute the following script:
```bash
chmod +x paraphrase/back-translation/back-translation-runner.sh
./paraphrase/back-translation/back-translation-runner.sh
```
